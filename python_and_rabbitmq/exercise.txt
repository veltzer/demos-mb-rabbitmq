- Bring up a rabbitmq server and see that you can connect to it.
	Run a rabbitmq server on your machine using *docker*!!!
	Find out the port on which it is listening and make sure it is open
	Demostrate that you can connect to that port using:
		$ telnet localhost [port]
		$ netstat -ln | grep [port]
		$ ss/ip [you find the right flags]
	See that process that is actually running using "ps -ef"
