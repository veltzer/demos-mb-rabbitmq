- Bring up a rabbitmq server and see that you can connect to it.
	Run a rabbitmq server on your machine using *docker*!!!
	Find out the port on which it is listening and make sure it is open
	Demostrate that you can connect to that port using:
		$ telnet localhost [port]
		$ netstat -ln | grep [port]
		$ ss/ip [you find the right flags]
	See that process that is actually running using "ps -ef"

- Put messages on the rabbitmq server and get them back using python code.
	hint:
	- you may need to install modules for this to work.
		(remember: pip install --user [modulename])
	- you may need to define a queue on which to put and get message.
